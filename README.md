> https://store.evmos.org/dapps/defi/burn-auction

## Documentation

Pre-requisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20.16.0 or higher)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install

cp .env.example .env
# edit the .env file with your own values
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev # to run all the services (next, dappstore, indexer)

# or run each service separately
pnpm dev:next # to run only the next.js app
pnpm dev:dappstore # to run the dappstore sdk preview that handles the wallet connection
pnpm dev:indexer # to run the indexer that indexes the blockchain events into the database
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Test with a local node

Follow the instructions described in this issue in order to run a local node with the Burn Auction module enabled: https://github.com/evmos/burn-auction-dapp/issues/5

### Indexing Endpoints

To index blockchain events into the database, you can use the following endpoints:

- `/api/v1/indexer/bid-events`: Indexes bid events from the blockchain to the database.
- `/api/v1/indexer/auction-end-events`: Indexes auction end events from the blockchain to the database.

These endpoints will index events from the block number specified in `process.env.FIRST_AUCTION_BLOCK` to the latest block number in batches of 10000 blocks.

In order to have the dApp work properly you will need a cron job to call these indexing endpoints ideally at every block, in practice every 30 seconds should be enough.
